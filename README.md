# E-Commerce Back End

  ## Description
  My motivation in building the project was to learn more about back-end development and how it connects with the front-end. I built this project to demonstrate how to develop the back end of a project, connected to a database. The project solves the problem of not having a functioning back-end. I learned a lot about sequelize.

  ## Installation
  
  One needs to install dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize.  These can be installed via npm install in the command line.

  ## Usage

  To use the project one first needs to run mysql by entering mysql -u root -p in the command line. Next one  types source db/schema.sql. Next one types exit to exit mysql. One then can run the server by typing npm run watch. Finally one can test the routes to see if they're working properly by opening Insomnia.
